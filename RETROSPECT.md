# Retrospect

This was a super fun project even though I am submitting it in a state that I am not happy with. The good news is that the technical challenge I was given regardless of my destiny with Vaultie, has provided me with something tangible to continue working on. Side Projects are always appreciated.

If I was to do things differently, I would have used the AWS SDK to upload all the PDF's to an S3 bucket and have them available for retrieval in a gallery. I would like to have two sections of the application; one where a user can upload and view a single PDF and two, a separate page that is a grid gallery showing thumbnails of all the PDF's uploaded to S3 and some metadata on them like timestamps and filesizes. I also wish I invested the time in docker-compose rather than using concurrently.

The project was a lot of fun to work on and even though I didn't quite achieve what I was intending to do, it left me in a good place with some development tasks to still complete on my own time.

Thank you very much for your interest in me.
